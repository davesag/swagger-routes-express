[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/davesag/swagger-routes-express/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/davesag/swagger-routes-express/tree/develop)

## Assumptions

This library assumes you are using:

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) _version 6.4.0_ or better,
2. [`expressjs`](http://www.expressjs.com) _any version_, and
3. [`swagger`](http://swagger.io) _version 2_, or [`OpenAPI`](https://www.openapis.org) _version 3_.

## Install

Add `swagger-routes-express` as a `dependency`:

```sh
npm i swagger-routes-express
```

## Examples

### A simple API

Assume the following API route controllers, defined in `./api/index.js` as follows:

```js
const { name, version, description } = require('../../package.json')

const versions = (req, res) => {
  res.json([
    {
      version: 1,
      path: '/api/v1'
    }
  ])
}

const ping = (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    name,
    description,
    version,
    uptime: process.uptime()
  })
}

module.exports = { ping, versions }
```

### Swagger Version 2 example

Given a Swagger (v2) YAML file `api.yml` along the lines of:

```yml
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  description: Something about the API
  version: '1.0.0'
  title: 'Test API'
basePath: '/api/v1'
schemes:
  - 'https'
  - 'http'
paths:
  /:
    get:
      tags:
        - 'root'
      summary: 'Get API Version Information'
      description: 'Returns a list of the available API versions'
      operationId: 'versions'
      produces:
        - 'application/json'
      responses:
        200:
          description: 'success'
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ArrayOfVersions'
  /ping:
    get:
      tags:
        - 'root'
      summary: 'Get Server Information'
      description: 'Returns information about the server'
      operationId: 'ping'
      produces:
        - 'application/json'
      responses:
        200:
          description: 'success'
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ServerInfo'
definitions:
  # see https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types
  APIVersion:
    type: 'object'
    properties:
      version:
        type: 'integer'
        format: 'int64'
      path:
        type: 'string'
  ServerInfo:
    type: 'object'
    properties:
      name:
        type: 'string'
      description:
        type: 'string'
      version:
        type: 'string'
      uptime:
        type: 'number'
  ArrayOfVersions:
    type: 'array'
    items:
      $ref: '#/definitions/APIVersion'
```

        $ref: '#/components/schemas/APIVersion'
```

## Connecting your Express server

You can `connect` your `Express` app or router as follows:

```js
const express = require('express')
const YAML = require('yamljs')
const { connector } = require('swagger-routes-express')
const api = require('./api')

const makeApp = () => {
  const apiDefinition = YAML.load('api.yml') // load the api as json
  const connect = connector(api, apiDefinition) // make the connector
  const app = express() // make the app

  // do any other app stuff, such as wire in passport, use cors etc

  connect(app) // attach the routes

  // add any error handlers last

  return app
}
```

With the result that requests to `GET /` will invoke the `versions` controller and a request to `/ping` will invoke the `ping` controller.

## Options

You can pass in an optional `options` object as a third parameter to the `connector` function.

```js
const connect = connector(api, apiDefinition, options)
```

If you don't pass in any options the defaults are:

```js
{
  security: {},
  middleware: {},
  onCreateRoute: undefined,
  apiSeparator: '_',
  notFound: : require('./routes/notFound'),
  notImplemented: require('./routes/notImplemented'),
  rootTag: 'root', // only used in Swagger V2 docs
  variables: {}, // only used in OpenAPI v3 docs
  INVALID_VERSION: require('./errors').INVALID_VERSION
}
```

### Adding security middleware handlers

There are several ways to add middleware handlers, and they can be combined to provide a high degree of customisation and flexibility.

#### Specify Auth middleware by name in the API definition yml file

If your swagger document defines security, you can map this to your own Auth Middleware by passing in a `security` option to the `connector`.

##### Security with scopes

For example if your path defines oAuth style `security` like:

```yml
paths:
  /private
    get:
      summary: some private route
      security:
        - access: ['read', 'write']
  /admin
    get:
      summary: some admin route
      security:
        - access: ['admin']
```

Supply a `security` option as follows

```js
const options = {
  security: {
    'read,write': readWriteAuthMiddlewareFunction,
    admin: adminAuthMiddlewareFunction
  }
}
```

##### Security without scopes

If your path defines `security`, and its `scopes` array is empty, you use its name in the `security` option.

Given:

```yml
paths:
  /private
    get:
      summary: some private route
      security:
        - apiKey: []
```

Supply a `security` option like:

```js
const options = {
  security: {
    apiKey: myAuthMiddlewareFunction
  }
}
```

#### Return an array of controllers

Your API might wish to leverage some middleware functions but you don't want to have to specify them all in the API document itself.

Your API controller functions themselves can return arrays of controller functions.

##### Example

In this case `/api/v1/createThings/index.js` returns an array of controller functions with bespoke middleware controllers running in sequence, and then runs the controller in `/api/v1/createThings/createThings.js`

`/api/v1/createThings/index.js`

```js
const { checkIfAllowed, stripPII } = require('middleware')
const actuallyCreateThings = require('./createThings')

const createThings = [checkIfAllowed, stripPII, actuallyCreateThings]
```

The array of middleware and your controller will be executed in order, so it's important to put your actual controller logic last.

#### Global security definitions

Both Swagger V2 and OpenAPI V3 allow you to define global `security`. The global `security` definition will be applied if there is no path-specific one defined.

##### Exempting a path from global security

If you've defined global `security` but wish to exempt a specific path, then you can configure the path like:

```yml
paths:
  /my-route
    get:
      summary: some route that is exempt from the default security
      security: []
```

#### Further reading on Swagger and security

- [Swagger V2 Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/authentication/), and
- [Open API V3 Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) docs.

#### Notes

- Only the **first** security option is used, the others are ignored. Your Auth Middleware function must handle any alternative authentication schemes. This can be achieved by returning an array of middleware controllers that culminates in the specific api controller you want.
- Security middleware, wither defined at the global or path level, is applied first, then any controller specific arrays of middleware are applied,
- Scopes, if supplied, are sorted alphabetically.

#### What's an Auth Middleware function?

An Auth Middleware Function is simply an [Express Middleware function](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) that checks to see if the user making the request is allowed to do so.

How this actually works in your server's case is going to be completely application specific, but the general idea is your app needs to be able to log users in, or accept a token from a header, or somehow otherwise stick a user id, or some roles, into `req.user` or `req.session.user` or something like that. There are dozens of ways to do this. I recommend using something like [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/) to handle the specifics.

Your Auth Middleware then just needs to check that the user / roles you've stored corresponds with what you'd like to allow that user to do.

```js
async function correspondingMiddlewareFunction(req, res, next) {
  // previously you have added a userId to req (say from an 'Authorization: Bearer token' header)
  // how you check that the token is valid is up to your app's logic
  if (await isValidToken(req.user.token)) return next()

  // otherwise reject with an error
  return res.status(401).json({ error: "I'm afraid you can't do that" })
}
```

### Adding other path-level middleware

You can add your own path specific middleware by passing in a `middleware` option:

```js
{
  middleware: {
    myMiddleware: someMiddlewareFunction
  }
}
```

With either Swagger v2 or OpenAPI v3, add an `x-middleware` option in the path specification:

```yml
paths:
  /special:
    get:
      summary: some special route
      x-middleware:
        - myMiddleware
```

The `someMiddlewareFunction` will be inserted **after** any Auth Middleware.

### Adding hooks

You can supply an `onCreateRoute` handler function with the options with signature

```js
const onCreateRoute = (method, descriptor) => {
  const [path, ...handlers] = descriptor
  console.log('created route', method, path, handlers)
}
```

The method will be one of 'get', 'post', 'patch', 'put', or 'delete'.

The `descriptor` is an array of:

```js
;[
  path, // a string. Swagger param formats will have been converted to express route formats.
  security, // an auth middleware function (if needed)
  ...middleware, // other middleware functions (if supplied)
  controller //  then finally the route controller function
]
```

### Mapping to nested API routes

If your `./api` folder contains nested controllers such as:

```text
/api/v1/createThing.js
```

It's not uncommon for `./index.js` to expose this as `v1_createThing`, but in swagger the `operationId` might specify it as `v1/createThing`.

You can supply your own `apiSeparator` option in place of `_` to map from `/`.

### Arrays of route controllers

In this case `/api/v1/createThings.js` returns an array of controller functions with bespoke middleware controllers running in sequence. This is a shortcut for otherwise specifying middleware as outlined above.

### Missing Route Controllers

If a route controller is defined as an `operationId` in Swagger but there is no corresponding controller, a default `notImplemented` controller will be inserted that simply responds with a `501` error. You can also specify your own `notImplemented` controller in `options`.

If no `operationId` is supplied for a path then a default `notFound` controller that responds with a `404` status will be inserted. You can also specify your own `notFound` controller in `options`.

### Base paths

#### Swagger Version 2

For the root path `/` we check the route's `tags`. If the first `tag` defined for a path is `'root'` we don't inject the api `basePath`, otherwise we do. You can define your own `rootTag` option to override this behaviour.

#### OpenAPI Version 3

The OpenAPI V3 format allows you to define both a default `servers` array, and `path` specific `servers` arrays. The `url` fields in those arrays are parsed, ignoring any absolute URLS (as they are deemed to refer to controllers external to this API Server).

The spec allows you to include template variables in the `servers`' `url` field. To accommodate this you can supply a `variables` option in `options`. Any variables you specify will be substituted.

## Generating API summary information

You can generate a summary of your Swagger v2 or OpenAPI v3 API specification in the form:

```js
{
  info: { name, version, description },
  paths: { [method]: ['/array', '/of', '/normalised/:paths'] }
}
```

as follows:

```js
const YAML = require('yamljs')
const { summarise } = require('swagger-routes-express')

const apiDefinition = YAML.load('api.yml')
const apiSummary = summarise(apiDefinition)
```

## Upgrading from Swagger Routes Express V2 to V3

These docs refer to Version 3 of Swagger Routes Express which changed the way you invoke the `connector`.

### The old way

```js
const connector = require('swagger-routes-express')
```

### The new way

```js
const { connector } = require('swagger-routes-express')
```
